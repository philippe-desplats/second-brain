# Changelog

Structural changes to this workspace. Content changes (notes, projects) are tracked by git history, not here.

`Unreleased` is your own section, and this file stays yours: the update recipe in [README.md](README.md#keeping-your-clone-up-to-date) never overwrites it. The numbered releases below it document what each boilerplate version changed in the infrastructure that recipe does pull, so read them before applying one.

## Unreleased

- Initial workspace bootstrap from the Second Brain Structure boilerplate.

## 0.3.0

Realignment on Basic Memory, verified against versions 0.21.1 and 0.22.1. Basic Memory 0.21 or later is now the recommended floor, and everything below still degrades gracefully without it.

- **Schemas now carry two contracts.** `settings.frontmatter:` declares the YAML fields, `schema:` declares the body observations and relations. Basic Memory validates the top-level block against the note body, so the previous single-block shape would have reported every frontmatter field as a missing observation. Measured on the demo content shipped with the boilerplate, indexed as a real project: 20 notes across 7 types, zero error.
- **Schema version key renamed** from `schema_version:` to `version:` in the 15 schema files, the key Basic Memory actually reads. Notes keep `schema_version:`, which declares the version they conform to.
- **`/sb-doctor` goes from nine checks to eleven**, adding a graph orphan cross-check (`bm orphans`) and schema validation (`bm schema validate --strict`), both skipped when Basic Memory is absent.
- **The maintenance scripts dropped their last dependency.** All 12 run on the Python 3 standard library, PyYAML included nowhere. `generate_indexes.py` and `auto_link_entities.py` no longer fail on a clean machine.
- **`/sb-init` Basic Memory setup corrected.** The project is created with `--local`, so cloud mode never captures it silently. The embedding guidance matches reality: embeddings build at first startup, and `bm reindex --embeddings` rebuilds them. The ignore list gained the few file names that are unambiguous, and a warning that is worth more than the list: Basic Memory matches ignore patterns against a file name relative to its own parent directory, so a pattern is global whatever it looks like and a leading slash anchors nothing. Adding `README.md` there drops every project brief from the index, adding `CLAUDE.md` drops every client and partner context.
- **`CLAUDE.md` documents the search filters** that map onto the workspace frontmatter: `search_type`, `note_types`, `tags`, `status`, `after_date`, `min_similarity`.
- **Frontmatter made parseable everywhere.** Four files carried YAML a strict parser rejected, three skills and the map of content template. This matters for agents other than Claude Code, which read the same files with a standard YAML parser.
- **A demo partner ships alongside the demo client.** Proseware referred Globex, so the mandatory symmetric pair (`referred_by` on the client, `brings_lead` on the partner) is now demonstrated by real files instead of being documented in the abstract, and `check_symmetric_relations.py` has something to check. `/sb-init` removes both demos together through the manifest.
- **The schemas stopped enumerating the zones.** Each one used to list four near-identical paths, one per zone, plus prose counting them. Every enumeration broke the day a zone was pruned at setup. They now state one pattern, `sources/{zone}/{entity}/{project}/...`, followed by a concrete path from the demo content so the example stays readable. The schema count is written in exactly one place.
- **Setup adapts to the zones you keep.** `/sb-init` writes the `zones` array only after the prune has actually run, so a zone the safety gate refused to delete can never be declared absent while it still holds your data, and `/capture`, `/curate`, `/ops-init-project` and `/ops-weekly-pulse` resolve the live list from that array instead of assuming four zones.

If you customized a schema or a script locally, re-apply your change after checking out this update, or exclude that file from the checkout. `.sb-config.json` is yours and stays out of the recipe, so set its `boilerplate_version` to `0.3.0` by hand once you have applied this release, otherwise it keeps reporting the version you cloned.
